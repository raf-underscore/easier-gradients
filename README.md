For anyone who uses Figma on a regular basis, you would have probably faced issues with the gradients tool when trying to create some gradients. The main issue I commonly faced was spacing out the stops evenly and flip the gradient around. Due to these annoyances, I decided to make a Figma plugin to make these issues easier.

Easier gradients helps you with those annoying parts you always wished you didn't have to go through, like flipping gradients, or choosing the exact angle you want. Gradients will be easier to work with than ever with this plugin, and I hope it makes your time working with Figma, easier.

## Usage

To use this plugin, you must have a layer that contains a gradient as a fill. You can then run the plugin and use the availabe options to manipulate the gradient however you want to.

## Running Localy

### Setup
```
# git clone https://github.com/raf-underscore/easier-gradients.git
# cd easier-gradients
# npm install
# npm run watch
```
### Running development version on Figma

1. Navigate to Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest
2. Run the plugin from Figma
